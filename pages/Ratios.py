This Dividend App leverages a combination of WRDS (Wharton Research Data Services) and real-time financials from yfinance to generate accurate and meaningful financial ratios.

- **WRDS / CRSP**  
  Used for training data, historical dividend payout information, and standardized financial ratios from the Financial Ratios Suite by WRDS and CRSP (Center for Research in Security Prices).  
  - The data cleaning included only keeping true dividend payment columns as well as relevant ratios.  
  - A new column was created to classify dividend changes as an increase, decrease, or no change based on the next quarterâ€™s dividend.  
  - Each company was assigned an industry label based on the ticker.  
  - Missing values across key financial ratios were filled using ticker-specific averages.  
  - Liquidity ratios were defaulted to zero for financial companies, as these firms typically do not report or rely on these ratios due to their business structure.

- **yfinance**  
  Used for live testing data. Financial ratios are calculated manually by combining line items from income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements.

These ratios provide insights into a company's dividend reliability, profitability, leverage, liquidity, cash flow health, and market valuation.

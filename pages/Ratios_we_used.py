st.markdown("""
This Dividend App leverages a combination of WRDS (Wharton Research Data Services) and real-time financials from yfinance to generate accurate and meaningful financial ratios.
-	WRDS / CRSP: 
                - Used for training data, historical dividend payout information, and standardized financial ratios from the Financial Ratios Suite by WRDS and CRSP (Center for Research in Security Prices).
                - The data cleaning included only keeping true dividend payment columns as well as relevant ratios. A new column was created to classify dividend changes as an increase, decrease, or no change based on the next quarterâ€™s dividend. 
                - Each company was assigned an industry label based on the ticker. Missing values across key financial ratios were filled using ticker specific averages. 
                - Liquidity ratios were defaulted to zero for financial companies, as these firms typically do not report or rely on these ratios due to their business structure. 
-	yfinance: Used for live testing data. Financial ratios are calculated manually by combining line items from income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements.
These ratios provide insights into a company's dividend reliability, profitability, leverage, liquidity, cash flow health, and market valuation.
